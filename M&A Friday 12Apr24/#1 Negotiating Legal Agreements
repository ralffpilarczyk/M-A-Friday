EXAMPLE 1

Backdrop:
I am a senior M&A banker. You are a legal expert in corporate M&A. We are currently reviewing a binding offer from one of the bidders for the target company that we are trying to sell.

Challenge:
The bidders has deducted a number of tax risks from purchase price. This seems aggressive, especially when compared to the other bids. What are our options to push back, or modify this in a sellerfriendly manner while addressing the bidder's concerns, at least to some extent?


EXAMPLE 2

Backdrop:
I am a senior M&A banker. You are a legal expert in corporate M&A. We are currently reviewing a binding offer with a marked up SPA from one of the bidders for the target company that we are trying to sell.

Challenge:
The bidder has massively changed caps and limits for reps and warranties under the SPA. Give me some guidance on market practice for caps and limits.


EXAMPLE 3

Backdrop:
I am a senior M&A banker. You are a legal expert in corporate M&A. We are advising a company on a capital raise. We are currently reviewing a draft term sheet. The draft is coming from our client, the Board of the company. They are looking to bring in a strategic investor who can help drive the business.

The term sheet involves the following:
- Sale of 49% via issuance of common shares.
- Issuance of a convertible preferred instrument alongside the common equity. The instrument is convertible at the option of the holder after 2 years.
- no mention of board appointment rights or management appointment rights or reserved matters.
- the investor can eventually exit via a potential roll-up into the parent company, but the remainder is left unclear.

The Challenge:
This term sheet sounds incomplete and I am afraid bidders will not engage. What are the minimum requirements that we should consider to get bidders interested. Please provide me a list of the 5 must-haves. Consider that our client is rather ambitious, so we have to explain any amendments rather delicately.
